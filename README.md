### Selected Topic
An analysis of global unemployment data from 2014-2024

### Topic Selection & Hypotheses

Our team will leverage the **Global Unemployment Data sourced from Kaggle ** to explore and test various hypotheses pertaining to global unemployment trends from 2014 to 2024. Our analyses will encompass a range of inquiries, including but not limited to:

**Trend Analysis:** We will examine how the global unemployment rate has evolved over the specified timeframe (2014-2024). By analyzing annual variations, we aim to identify overarching patterns and potential drivers influencing global unemployment dynamics.

**Country-Level Analysis:** Our investigation will delve into identifying the countries with the highest and lowest average annual unemployment rates in 2020. This examination will offer insights into the disparities in labor market conditions across different regions of the world.

**Age Group Analysis: **We will investigate which age group exhibits the highest average unemployment rate on a global scale. Understanding the differential impact of unemployment across various age demographics will shed light on demographic-specific challenges and opportunities.

**Predictive Modeling:** Employing advanced statistical techniques, we will assess the predictive power of different factors or indicators in forecasting future unemployment trends. By identifying the most influential predictors, we aim to develop robust models for anticipating and mitigating future unemployment challenges.

### Description of Source Data
Our project utilized the dataset from Kaggle: from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/global-unemployment-data

The data was stored in CSV format files, from 2014 to 2024. 

In total, our final dataset utilized a CSV file with over 1,135 rows and 13 columns.

Our data was broken up into several sections that led the way for our analysis. 

**country_name**
    Description: Name of the Country (Alphabetically categorized, contains at least a few countries from each continent, great regional variety)

**indicator_name**
    Description: Unemployment

**sex**
    Description: Gender (Male/Female)

**age_group**
    Description: Age groups categorized as Under 15, 15-24, 24+

**age_categories**
    Description: Age categories further classified as Children, Youth, Adult


### Analysis Question

- How has the global unemployment rate changed over the years (2014-2024)?
- What are the countries with the highest and lowest average annual unemployment rates in 2020?
- Which age group has the highest average unemployment rate globally?
- Which factors or indicators are most predictive of future unemployment trends?

ct the null hypothesis in the context of the Dickey-Fuller test, it indicates that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the time series data is stationary. In other words, rejecting the null hypothesis means that there is a presence of a unit root, and the data is not exhibiting a unit root process, which suggests that the data series is stationary or does not have a trend.

In practical terms, rejecting the null hypothesis typically implies that the time series data has properties that make it suitable for certain types of analysis or modeling techniques that assume stationarity. It suggests that the data does not have a consistent trend over time and may exhibit more predictable behavior. This can be important for various statistical analyses, forecasting, and modeling tasks where stationarity is an important assumption.
